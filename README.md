# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard
## About The Project
In this app, user can enter the name of a city to search current and future weather forecast. Search result includes city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. UV index represent color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. Additionally, a 5-day forecast for that city is displayed below the current conditions. For quick access, user can click on a city in the search history to see current and future weather for that city. The work showcases skill learned: Server-Side APIs, Bootstrap, JavaScript and Moment.js. The project uses OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve current and future weather data for cities.
